 * This is useful if you need to attach objects to your context on a per-request basis, for example

 * 
 * ------------
 * Options API
 * ------------
 * The GraphQLOptions object has the following properties:
 * 
 * -------
 * schema
 * -------
 * The GraphQL.js schema object that represents your GraphQL schema. You can create this directly 
 * using GraphQL.js, the reference GraphQL implementation, or you can use graphql-tools, which 
 * makes it simple to combine a schema and resolvers.
 * 
 * --------
 * context
 * --------
 * The context is an object thatâ€™s accessible in every single resolver as the third argument. This 
 * is a great place to pass information that depends on the current request.

/**
 * ----------
 * rootValue
 * ----------
 * This is the value passed as the obj argument into the root resolvers. Read more about resolvers 
 * and their arguments in the graphql-tools docs. Note: This feature is not often used, since in 
 * most cases context is a better option to pass per-request data into resolvers.
 * 
 * ------------
 * formatError
 * ------------
 * A function to format errors before they are returned to the client. GraphQL does some processing 
 * on errors by default, and this is a great place to customize that. You can also access the 
 * original thrown error on the .originalError property:
 */

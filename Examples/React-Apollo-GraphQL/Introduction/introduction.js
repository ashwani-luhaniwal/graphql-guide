/**
 * In the previous tutorials, you learned about major concepts and benefits of GraphQL. Now is 
 * the time to get your hands dirty and start out with an actual project!
 * 
 * You’re going to build a simple clone of Hackernews. Here’s a list of the features the app 
 * will have:
 *  - Display a list of links
 *  - Search the list of links
 *  - Users can authenticate
 *  - Authenticated users can create new links
 *  - Authenticated users can upvote links (one vote per link and user)
 *  - Realtime updates when other users upvote a link or create a new one
 * 
 * In this track, you’ll use the following technologies for building the app:
 *  Frontend:
 *      React: Frontend framework for building user interfaces
 *      Apollo Client 2.0: Production-ready, caching GraphQL client
 *  Backend:
 *      graphql-yoga: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance & great 
 *          developer experience
 *      Prisma: Open-source GraphQL API layer that turns your database into a GraphQL API
 * 
 * You’ll create the React project with create-react-app, a popular command-line tool that gives 
 * you a blank project with all required build configuration already setup.
